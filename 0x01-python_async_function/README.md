 Python Async Project

 Project Overview
his project focuses on learning and implementing asynchronous programming in Python using the `asyncio` library. Asynchronous programming allows for concurrent execution of tasks, making it particularly useful for I/O-bound operations. The tasks in this project involve creating asynchronous coroutines, executing them concurrently, and measuring their runtime.

 File Descriptions

 0-basic_async_syntax.py
his file contains the function `wait_random`, an asynchronous coroutine that takes an integer `max_delay` as an argument (default is 10). It waits for a random delay between 0 and `max_delay` (inclusive) and returns the delay.

 1-concurrent_coroutines.py
his file includes the function `wait_n`, which spawns `n` instances of `wait_random` with a specified `max_delay`. It returns a list of all the delays in the order they complete, without using the `sort()` function.

 2-measure_runtime.py
his file defines the `measure_time` function, which takes integers `n` and `max_delay` as arguments. It measures the total execution time for running `wait_n(n, max_delay)` and returns the average time per coroutine.

 3-tasks.py
his file introduces the function `task_wait_random`, which takes an integer `max_delay` and returns an `asyncio.Task`. This allows for creating a task without awaiting it immediately, enabling concurrent execution.

 4-tasks.py
his file modifies the `wait_n` function from `1-concurrent_coroutines.py` into a new function called `task_wait_n`. Instead of directly calling `wait_random`, it uses `task_wait_random` to achieve similar functionality with tasks.



his README provides an overview and brief description of each file's purpose and functionality in the context of asynchronous programming.
