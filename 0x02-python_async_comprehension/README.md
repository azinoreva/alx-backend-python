 0x02. Python - Async Comprehension

This project explores asynchronous programming in Python, focusing on async generators and comprehensions. By the end, you'll be able to write and understand asynchronous generators, use async comprehensions, and type-annotate generators.

 Files

- 0-async_generator.py**: Implements an async generator that yields random numbers asynchronously.
- 1-async_comprehension.py**: Collects 10 random numbers using async comprehensions.
- 2-measure_runtime.py**: Measures the runtime for running four async comprehensions in parallel.
